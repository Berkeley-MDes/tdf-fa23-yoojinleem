### Reflections ### 

- Last week, I followed TJ's tutorial, learning how to change the existing design, modify it, and export it for 3D printing. In fact, up until the week before, I was not familiar with the concepts of Rhino, especially Grasshopper, so most of the modifications were done on the AI site rather than within the Grasshopper interface. Following the tutorial made many things much easier to understand, so it was helpful.

- I changed the blue 3D stand to pink and turned the Preview on and off one by one to see the differences. Below are the photos I shared of that process.

### Speculations ###

- I've now learned the basic structure of Rhino and Grasshopper. However, while following the tutorial, I noticed that my UI is somewhat different from TJ's UI. Additionally, I am not fully aware of the basic shortcuts and operation methods for zooming and moving. Moving forward, what I hope to achieve is to navigate well and be able to replicate exactly what I have manipulated.

### Summary ###

- The term "Bake" was particularly memorable for me. I was confused about how "Bake" differs from "Save" and "Export", and why such a cute word suddenly popped up. But now, I think I can clearly understand the relationship between Grasshopper and Rhino.

- However, what was disappointing is that I am still at the stage of "manipulating existing designs." Truly knowing how to use Rhino should not be limited to just adjusting existing files. Instead, it means being able to create something entirely new based on my sketches. Through this, I see the need for next week's version of me to design my own creation, implement it in 3D, and go through the printing process.
