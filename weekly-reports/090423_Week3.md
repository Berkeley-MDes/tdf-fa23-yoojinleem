## Week of 09/04/23 (Week3) ##


### Reflections ### 

- Last week, I followed TJ's tutorial, learning how to change the existing design, modify it, and export it for 3D printing. In fact, up until the week before, I was not familiar with the concepts of Rhino, especially Grasshopper, so most of the modifications were done on the AI site rather than within the Grasshopper interface. Following the tutorial made many things much easier to understand, so it was helpful.

- I changed the blue 3D stand to pink and turned the Preview on and off one by one to see the differences. Below are the photos I shared of that process.

### Speculations ###

- I've now learned the basic structure of Rhino and Grasshopper. However, while following the tutorial, I noticed that my UI is somewhat different from TJ's UI. Additionally, I am not fully aware of the basic shortcuts and operation methods for zooming and moving. Moving forward, what I hope to achieve is to navigate well and be able to replicate exactly what I have manipulated.

### Summary ###

- This week seemed to be a time of setting the framework. Of course, even this initial step was challenging for me. As I delve deeper into this realm, I anticipate getting lost amid the multitude of techniques and the intricacies of 3D. Still, I hope to overcome future challenges with the lessons I learned this week. It's an exciting week, knowing there's so much more to learn.

- From what I can tell, mastering 3D in just one semester seems nearly impossible. However, I'm inclined to try out various tools simultaneously. I suspect the gaps between these tools won't be too vast. Most of my design friends frequently use Blender, a graphic-based free tool, so I intend to explore it as well.

- Having some experience with Figma, I'd like to teach my peers about symbols and share shortcuts that will be useful as the course progresses. With technology on our side, I believe we can live more efficiently. This prospect feels refreshing and, simultaneously, both exciting and daunting.
