### Reflections ### 

- Last week, I followed TJ's tutorial, learning how to change the existing design, modify it, and export it for 3D printing. In fact, up until the week before, I was not familiar with the concepts of Rhino, especially Grasshopper, so most of the modifications were done on the AI site rather than within the Grasshopper interface. Following the tutorial made many things much easier to understand, so it was helpful.

- I changed the blue 3D stand to pink and turned the Preview on and off one by one to see the differences. Below are the photos I shared of that process.

- Before laser cutting, I learned that one needs to open the lid of the laser cutting machine to set the laser's position.

- However, I realized that not all of these changes occurred solely in Grasshopper, leading to the insight that I need to dive deeper into understanding the tool.


### Speculations ###

- What would a completely new holder look like if I were to design it? I recently purchased a laptop holder to dock my laptop. During the buying process, I found that there were holders that were 'completely fixed' in place, but there were also holders where you could pull up a flat base to adjust the height. As a typical consumer, I used to just contemplate what would be more convenient. Now, as a designer, I can analyze the pros and cons from a different perspective, which I believe will positively influence my future purchases.

- In particular, the adjustable holder I purchased has the advantage of being able to change both its height and angle. However, its fixation isn't as strong, so when typing on the keyboard, the monitor shakes quite a bit. As with any design, there are downsides. Through this purchase and design experience, I realized the potential for crafting more meticulous and human-centered designs in the future.


### Summary ###

- This week seemed to be a time of setting the framework. Of course, even this initial step was challenging for me. As I delve deeper into this realm, I anticipate getting lost amid the multitude of techniques and the intricacies of 3D. Still, I hope to overcome future challenges with the lessons I learned this week. It's an exciting week, knowing there's so much more to learn.

- From what I can tell, mastering 3D in just one semester seems nearly impossible. However, I'm inclined to try out various tools simultaneously. I suspect the gaps between these tools won't be too vast. Most of my design friends frequently use Blender, a graphic-based free tool, so I intend to explore it as well.

- Having some experience with Figma, I'd like to teach my peers about symbols and share shortcuts that will be useful as the course progresses. With technology on our side, I believe we can live more efficiently. This prospect feels refreshing and, simultaneously, both exciting and daunting.
