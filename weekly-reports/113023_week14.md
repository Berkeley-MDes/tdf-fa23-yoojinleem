## Week of 11/30/23 (Week14) ##


### Reflections ### 
-This week, we discussed what to purchase and ended up buying an electromagnet and power supplier. Sudhu and Jeff, who had experience with similar projects, helped us out, but their differing opinions at times made it difficult to make the right decisions, especially since we were pressed for time.

We looked at tutorials on YouTube to see how other developers created their projects, and this seemed to help us with the basic setup.

-After purchasing ferrofluid and experimenting with it, we realized how entertaining it is. However, when we tried using the electromagnet, the movement was less pronounced than expected, indicating the need for a new product. To achieve the level of movement we desire, it seems the power supplier also needs to be much more powerful.

### Speculations ###
- We want to create a synthesizer, but it seems like we're deciding to do so just for the sake of producing new sounds, without a clear concept of the synthesizer itself. It looks like we need to research this a bit more. It would be more interesting if the sounds were a bit more unique.

### Conclusion ###
- In our recent endeavors, we've explored the captivating potential of ferrofluid and its interaction with electromagnets, which led us to consider the creation of a synthesizer. However, we've recognized the need for a deeper understanding of synthesizers themselves, beyond just our desire to generate novel sounds. This realization points us towards the importance of thorough research and conceptual development in our project. We must delve into the fundamentals of synthesizer technology, understanding how it can be innovatively integrated with the unique properties of ferrofluid for a truly distinctive audio experience.

Looking ahead, our immediate focus will be on enhancing the interaction between ferrofluid and electromagnets. The current setup, with its limited movement and power, suggests the necessity of acquiring more potent electromagnets and a stronger power supplier. Simultaneously, we aim to develop a synthesizer with unique sound qualities that complement the visual spectacle of the ferrofluid. This dual approach of technical advancement and creative sound exploration will be crucial in achieving our goal of creating an innovative, multisensory experience that pushes the boundaries of audiovisual technology.
