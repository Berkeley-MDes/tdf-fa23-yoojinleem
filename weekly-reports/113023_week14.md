## Week of 11/16/23 (Week13) ##


### Reflections ### 
-This week, I talked with Wanlun and Stephanie because we thought we have common interests on the tdf work. I wanted to make a machine that works with micro controller.

- A few weeks ago, Wanlun and I were sharing references for personal projects we'd like to do in the future, and since our final project allowed for autonomy, we realized we wanted to work on the same project. I was interested in creating a mini machine that was more than just a prototype, with clear inputs and outputs, and this aligned with Wanlun's values. We initially wanted to create a machine using LEDs and shared this idea with Stephanie, who, sharing the same interest, agreed to collaborate with us on the project.

I was open to any technology, but I preferred something we hadn't used before. Stephanie suggested an idea involving fluid, and coincidentally, Wanlun and I had been discussing fluid in our shared materials. We decided to use magnetic fluid, especially after realizing that the material costs were manageable. Therefore, we agreed to proceed with a project where the output involved magnetic fluid.

### Speculations ###
- The key challenge for our project is deciding what input to use. The most basic idea we've considered is using a speaker. We're also contemplating linking it to musical instruments like synthesizers, drums, or keyboards.

Additionally, since magnetic fluid reacts to magnets, it could be fascinating to use a motor to adjust the angle of a magnet and create movement in the fluid. While using a speaker is an existing concept, finding a different input could make the project even more intriguing. However, just the possibility of using this material is already very exciting.


### Conclusion ###
- We're planning to align our schedules to work on the project, and I really hope for a high level of completion. I want to create something that reaches the level of a finished, commercial product. My idea is to use laser-cut aluminum sheets to showcase a blend of metal and wood.

In addition to this, considering the materials and technologies involved, it might be interesting to integrate some interactive elements into the project. For instance, incorporating sensors that react to environmental factors like light or sound could dynamically alter the behavior of the magnetic fluid, adding an extra layer of interactivity and appeal to the final product. This could not only enhance the aesthetic value but also demonstrate the potential of combining traditional materials with modern technology.
