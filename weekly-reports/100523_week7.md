## Week of 10/05/23 (Week7) ##


### Reflections ### 
- This week, our group has had several team meetings where we decided to split the teams and set team objectives. Our team chose to create a structure where a physical object moves away as a person approaches it. The principle is similar to that of autonomous vehicles, but instead of a car, there's a character, and we'll be making our own rails, which makes it distinct.

- After seeking advice, we realized that creating a life-sized rail using a 3D printer would take at least a month just for design and fabrication. Thus, we decided to produce it using laser cutting, similar to slot cars or a rail-blocking system. Stephanie took on the coding, while Yanru handled the product design. After getting the mechanism up and running, we agreed to focus on making it look more adorable.

### Speculations ###
- I'm not sure which team I'll be working with in the future, but the thought of creating something with this machine is both overwhelming and exciting. I chose based on two categories: something interesting and something meaningful. Even if it's something meaningful, I chose something within a narrow scope where I can make a difference. I feel a bit sorry thinking about how much I'll be asking my colleagues for help.

### Conclusion ###
- Becoming more familiar with Prothon 2 and acquiring the foundational knowledge to apply it to my work seems to depend on my effort. I want to do my best to contribute to creating a great piece with the team, and although my coding skills are lacking, I hope to help in other ways. I will strive to operate the numerous sensors inside this machine
