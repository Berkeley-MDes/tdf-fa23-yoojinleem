### Reflections ### 
-This week, our team successfully achieved our goals. We sourced a motor from the library and got it up and running. After installing the motor driver, we were able to make it move forward and backward and adjusted its speed. We also connected it to an Ultrasonic sensor and placed two additional batteries to ensure successful operation.

- From the cloud, we fetched data and configured a single button to switch between Friendly mode rabbit and Shy mode rabbit. As a result, communication between photons became feasible.

- We did face several challenges. Firstly, the purchase of the motor driver was problematic. The motor driver suitable for the photon was different from the one for Arduino. Thus, we had to refund the one we initially ordered and connected the Adafruit product available with Jeff. Interestingly, the photon and motor driver could be overlaid on top of each other. This allowed us to save a lot of breadboard space. However, an unexpected challenge arose during this process. We had to solder them together, something I hadn't done since middle school. Although it was initially daunting, Jeff demonstrated the procedure, helping us navigate through the process.

- Because the motor driver and photon were combined into one, there shouldn't have been any overlapping wires. Since the motor driver used I2C, we couldn't utilize D1. We initially input the sensor to D1, causing an issue where it only recognized as 0cm. This problem arose due to our oversight in not thoroughly reviewing the actual product tutorial and our lack of fundamental understanding in electrical engineering. Shm identified the problem and provided a solution. This experience emphasized the importance of having a basic understanding of the topic.

- Lastly, using a secondary button, we connected the second photon to the cloud to control its forward and backward movement. Stephanie seamlessly made the connection, enabling real-time communication. At first, I was skeptical about the necessity of using the cloud, but after reflecting on it, I realized its potential for greater versatility, making me more interested in further exploring photon's capabilities.

### Speculations ###
- Moving forward, I think it would be a good idea to incorporate AI to make the robot more familiar and user-friendly. In fact, in South Korea, there are cute robots at the airport that follow people around and act as chatbots. This rabbit robot could potentially serve as a personal healing robot or even assist with physical exercises. The future possibilities seem boundless.


### Conclusion ###
- During this assignment, it was clear what each of the three of us was responsible for, and everyone contributed significantly. I'm satisfied with how each of us pushed beyond our comfort zones. Even though it was a short period of time, we were able to solidify the basics of electrical engineering through our first experience with the photon. Learning how to read circuits was invaluable, and it allowed us to think about how to apply this knowledge in future projects. One key realization was the vast number of sensors available and how they can be utilized to create interactive artworks. This experience confirmed the possibility of creating physical versions of room escape quizzes, something I'm deeply interested in. Now, I feel that I've cultivated a sense of independence in problem-solving, making me more eager to consult with experts and delve deeper into the subject matter.
