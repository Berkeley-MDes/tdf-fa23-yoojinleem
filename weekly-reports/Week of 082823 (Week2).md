## Week of 08/23/23 (Week2) ##

**Reflections**
- This week, I learned several new tools necessary for crafting a project. I got a grasp of how to utilize Github's markdown, which I had always been indirectly exposed to, and I learned how to set up a basic structure to organize my work logs on Github.

- I attended a basic interface lecture on Rhino and Grasshopper and went through the process of modifying a pre-made design. I feel I still lack a comprehensive understanding of Rhino, so I intend to delve deeper during the long holiday.

- I adjusted designs in Illustrator for laser cutting. To experiment with the outcomes based on colors, I utilized Black, Blue, and Red, and all were successfully applied. Also, since the wooden board we used was thicker than others, I had to modify the insertion points of the original design. It fit well after the adjustments, which was very satisfying.
