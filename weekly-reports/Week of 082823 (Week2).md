## Week of 08/23/23 (Week2) ##


### Reflections ###

- This week, I learned several new tools necessary for crafting a project. I got a grasp of how to utilize Github's markdown, which I had always been indirectly exposed to, and I learned how to set up a basic structure to organize my work logs on Github.

- I attended a basic interface lecture on Rhino and Grasshopper and went through the process of modifying a pre-made design. I feel I still lack a comprehensive understanding of Rhino, so I intend to delve deeper during the long holiday.

- I adjusted designs in Illustrator for laser cutting. To experiment with the outcomes based on colors, I utilized Black, Blue, and Red, and all were successfully applied. Also, since the wooden board we used was thicker than others, I had to modify the insertion points of the original design. It fit well after the adjustments, which was very satisfying.

- Before laser cutting, I learned that one needs to open the lid of the laser cutting machine to set the laser's position.

- However, I realized that not all of these changes occurred solely in Grasshopper, leading to the insight that I need to dive deeper into understanding the tool.


### Speculations ###

- What would a completely new holder look like if I were to design it? I recently purchased a laptop holder to dock my laptop. During the buying process, I found that there were holders that were 'completely fixed' in place, but there were also holders where you could pull up a flat base to adjust the height. As a typical consumer, I used to just contemplate what would be more convenient. Now, as a designer, I can analyze the pros and cons from a different perspective, which I believe will positively influence my future purchases.

- In particular, the adjustable holder I purchased has the advantage of being able to change both its height and angle. However, its fixation isn't as strong, so when typing on the keyboard, the monitor shakes quite a bit. As with any design, there are downsides. Through this purchase and design experience, I realized the potential for crafting more meticulous and human-centered designs in the future.


### Summary ###

- This week seemed to be a time of setting the framework. Of course, even this initial step was challenging for me. As I delve deeper into this realm, I anticipate getting lost amid the multitude of techniques and the intricacies of 3D. Still, I hope to overcome future challenges with the lessons I learned this week. It's an exciting week, knowing there's so much more to learn.

- From what I can tell, mastering 3D in just one semester seems nearly impossible. However, I'm inclined to try out various tools simultaneously. I suspect the gaps between these tools won't be too vast. Most of my design friends frequently use Blender, a graphic-based free tool, so I intend to explore it as well.

- Having some experience with Figma, I'd like to teach my peers about symbols and share shortcuts that will be useful as the course progresses. With technology on our side, I believe we can live more efficiently. This prospect feels refreshing and, simultaneously, both exciting and daunting.
