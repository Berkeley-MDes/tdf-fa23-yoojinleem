## Week of 11/16/23 (Week13) ##


### Reflections ### 
-This week, I talked with Wanlun and Stephanie because we thought we have common interests on the tdf work. I wanted to make a machine that works with micro controller.

From a technical standpoint, I've been searching for aspects that could be more complex or suitable for 3D printing.
- And I am also considering art designs with a style where colors blend together, but I am still thinking about what would be good to add my own unique touch.

### Speculations ###
- Going forward, the things to consider include the size of the piece, the level of interactive relationship to be created, and the extent of technology integration. I am also contemplating the idea of creating a network and want to utilize dot graphics, but I need to think about how to do it without making it look too cute.


### Conclusion ###
- Especially, I liked the approach to art+tech that I was introduced to on Monday. The size was smaller than I had in mind, but I need to think about how to apply such an approach to make a machine seem alive.
