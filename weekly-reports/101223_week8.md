## Week of 10/05/23 (Week7) ##


### Reflections ### 
- This week, our group has had several team meetings where we decided to split the teams and set team objectives. Our team chose to create a structure where a physical object moves away as a person approaches it. The principle is similar to that of autonomous vehicles, but instead of a car, there's a character, and we'll be making our own rails, which makes it distinct.

- After seeking advice, we realized that creating a life-sized rail using a 3D printer would take at least a month just for design and fabrication. Thus, we decided to produce it using laser cutting, similar to slot cars or a rail-blocking system. Stephanie took on the coding, while Yanru handled the product design. After getting the mechanism up and running, we agreed to focus on making it look more adorable.

### Speculations ###
- In fact, not only do we need to drive the car, but its power will decrease when it hits the rail. We need to figure out how to address this issue effectively.
We also need to consider whether the sensor detects in one direction or if it needs to account for human approach from a full 360 degrees.

### Conclusion ###
- With only two weeks left, we need to produce a plausible work, making it crucial to approach this efficiently. I'd like to delve a bit deeper into research and get everything ready so we can immediately start the task at hand.
