## Week of 10/23/23 (Week8) ##


### Reflections ### 
-This week, I experimented with controlling a buzzer using photon and operating a PIR sensor. First, I had both a passive buzzer and an active buzzer. The passive buzzer can be set to a melody, while the active buzzer only produces a sound without a melody. Initially, I thought the circuitry was simple, but I was greatly taken aback when no sound was produced. The reason turned out to be that the input values for the photon were different from those of the Arduino. With Arduino, you can use just numbers, but with photon, it uses designations like D2, so it wasn't working because I had been using "2".

-Then I moved on to the PIR sensor, which was much more challenging. It was difficult because I couldn't determine whether it was working or not just by sound. I tried to connect an LED to see the status, but while the LED did light up, there were no on-off actions. Upon investigation, I found out that the PIR sensor required 5V, whereas the photon only provided 3.3V. It would have been helpful if this detailed information was available in the tutorial.

-So, I tried adding two resistors to convert the voltage, but to no avail. Upon asking around, I was informed that there was a converter in the kit, which allowed me to succeed with ease.

### Speculations ###
- This weekend, what I aim to achieve is to produce sound when the sensor is triggered. The sensors I plan to use include a PIR sensor, a distance sensor (which is said to be easier to manipulate), and a microphone. It feels a bit challenging to combine the two functionalities.

### Conclusion ###
- The biggest task next week will likely be integrating what our team has decided to do. For now, the major accomplishment this week was delegating our tasks and dividing the work according to what each member can do best. It's reassuring to see that everyone is handling their respective roles well. Additionally, I hope we can enhance the quality of our project to neatly finalize the packaging as well.
