## Week of 09/28/23 (Week6) ##


### Reflections ### 
- This week, I operated given code with Photon 2. Just following given steps from Github isn't that hard, and reminded me of using Arduino. I asked to Sudhu why are we using this instead of Arduino, and he said this device can also run without connecting cable. This is applicabable in cloud system.

- Also on tuesday, we had an invited lecturer from Adobe. I was super surprised by his work and that he brought all of his works. It was so inspiring for me and I wanted to make a computational artwork like him. It was mind-blowing!

- However, the problem was that when I brought it home and tried to operate it, it didn't turn on. I wondered if the battery was low, but it still didn't work even when connected to the computer, so I think I'll have to ask about this in today's class. The appeal of this device is its applicability, and I'm slightly scared that I might get stuck here.


### Speculations ###
- I'm not sure which team I'll be working with in the future, but the thought of creating something with this machine is both overwhelming and exciting. I chose based on two categories: something interesting and something meaningful. Even if it's something meaningful, I chose something within a narrow scope where I can make a difference. I feel a bit sorry thinking about how much I'll be asking my colleagues for help.

### Conclusion ###
- Becoming more familiar with Prothon 2 and acquiring the foundational knowledge to apply it to my work seems to depend on my effort. I want to do my best to contribute to creating a great piece with the team, and although my coding skills are lacking, I hope to help in other ways. I will strive to operate the numerous sensors inside this machine
