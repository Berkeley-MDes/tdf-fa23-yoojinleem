## Week of 10/26/23 (Week10) ##


### Reflections ### 
-This week, I joined Zero Width and played with the program. It was interesting because I really like LLM model before but seemed difficult to enter the world of AI.


### Speculations ###
- After this,I want to manage the code.


### Conclusion ###
- From weekend, I would love to start learning AI and language model.
