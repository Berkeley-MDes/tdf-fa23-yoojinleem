## Week of 10/26/23 (Week10) ##


### Reflections ### 
-This week, I joined Zero Width and played with the program. It was interesting because I really like LLM model before but seemed difficult to enter the world of AI.


### Speculations ###
- After this,I want to manage the code.
- I want to be able to not only use third-party creations but also to check and modify the code myself. Additionally, I want to understand better why the process is slow.


### Conclusion ###
- From weekend, I would love to start learning AI and language model.
- I actually found it very interesting that such programs exist. I feel the need to refine it further as if I've stepped right into the middle of new technology.
