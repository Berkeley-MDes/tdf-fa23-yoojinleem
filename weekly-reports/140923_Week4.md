## Week of 14/09/23 (Week4) ##


### Reflections ### 

- This week was the most progressive week at TDE. I tried replicating the much-feared Rhino and learned how to change parameters using Grasshopper. It felt incredibly refreshing to see the design in Rhino change with each parameter adjustment. Especially, being able to learn and incorporate the minor Rhino functions that I've been studying was enjoyable.
