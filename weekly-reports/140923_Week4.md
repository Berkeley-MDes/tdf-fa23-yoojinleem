## Week of 14/09/23 (Week4) ##


### Reflections ### 

- This week was the most progressive week at TDE. I tried replicating the much-feared Rhino and learned how to change parameters using Grasshopper. It felt incredibly refreshing to see the design in Rhino change with each parameter adjustment. Especially, being able to learn and incorporate the minor Rhino functions that I've been studying was enjoyable.

- I baked the design and made additional changes in Rhino, even updating it with my Instagram ID. I then saved the design as an STL file.

- I decided to print with Yunting and Sharon, but when we transferred my file to Cura, it wouldn't slice. We sought advice from Cody, and following his suggestion to try again, we were eventually able to print.

- However, due to an ink issue with the Prusa initially, we had to switch to the one in MDes Studio. Through these challenges, I realized that 3D printing always comes with unforeseen variables.
