## Week of 09/14/23 (Week4) ##


### Reflections ### 
- This week, I opened and installed each kit provided by TDF on my computer. I have used Arduino before, but the kit I just checked seemed to be a different one from Particle, not Arduino.

- First, I needed to connect the proton2 to my computer, but since I was using a computer that only supports USB C, I went to Target and purchased a Multiport Adapter. However, my device did not appear on the computer after connecting it. Upon closer inspection of the kit, I found a USB C cable included, so I successfully installed it. It was surprising that in the first case, although it was clearly connected to the computer, it did not appear because it was not directly connected.

- Following the tutorial Sudhu posted, I was able to succeed in steps 1 to 4 and check my Mac Address. For now, I'm proud to have made a good start.
