### Reflections ### 
-This week, I took some time to explore what I want to do. I am particularly aiming to create media art using the folding device from Particle. I've been looking for references about it and considering how the interactive media art that actually exists can differ from the work I'll create.

From a technical standpoint, I've been searching for aspects that could be more complex or suitable for 3D printing.
- And I am also considering art designs with a style where colors blend together, but I am still thinking about what would be good to add my own unique touch.

### Speculations ###
- Going forward, the things to consider include the size of the piece, the level of interactive relationship to be created, and the extent of technology integration. I am also contemplating the idea of creating a network and want to utilize dot graphics, but I need to think about how to do it without making it look too cute.


### Conclusion ###
- Especially, I liked the approach to art+tech that I was introduced to on Monday. The size was smaller than I had in mind, but I need to think about how to apply such an approach to make a machine seem alive.
